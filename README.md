# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

This project uses the K-Means clustering unsupervised learning model to group cryptocurrencies into 4 clusters based on 3 principal components.

## Results

Here is a 3D model of the 4 clustered created with the data, in relation to the 3 principal components determined by PCA:
